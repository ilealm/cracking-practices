[Partition](cracking_practices/partition/README.md)

Write code to partition a linked list around a value X, such that all nodes less than X come before all nodes greater than or equal to X. If X is contained within the list, the value of X only needs to after the element less than X. The partition element X can appear anywhere in the "right partition", it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
