[Partition](cracking_practices/partition/README.md)

- Write code to partition a linked list around a value X, such that all nodes less than X come before all nodes greater than or equal to X. If X is contained within the list, the value of X only needs to after the element less than X. The partition element X can appear anywhere in the "right partition", it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

[Sum List](cracking_practices/sum_list/README.md)

- You have 2 numbers represented by 2 linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1st digit is at the head of the list. White a function that adds the 2 numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
